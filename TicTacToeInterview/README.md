# Tic Tac Toe Interview
A demo project created during an interview for a Senior iOS Developer position with City National Bank. I got the offer and was so excited that I decided to complete the demo in full.

Originally the game had no UI and was only made up of game state. Key interview points were state management with enums, and time complexity when it came to determining if the game was over (either in a win or tie).
