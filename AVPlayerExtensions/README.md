# AVPlayer Extensions

This collection of extensions provides a simplified interface for use of `AVPlayer`. It introduces:

1. Combine publishers for `duration`, `periodicTime`, `timeControlStatus`, `status`, and `playerProgress`.
2. A new enum: `VideoPlayerState` that represents the combination of of the above values as a single state that is commonly desired by `AVPlayer` use cases.
3. Helpers for restarting and determining whether an `AVPlayer` has an audio track.
