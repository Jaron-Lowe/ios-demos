# Custom Text Field Layout
This small demo was made for a user in a [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwiftUI/comments/15z0bli/what_is_the_effective_way_to_achieve_this_ui/) as an example on how to create a text field with an icon and a rounded border.
It allows for customizing the icon and configuring the internal TextField without any custom modifiers.

This example assumes the usage of SF Symbol images but could easily have any custom image swapped out.
